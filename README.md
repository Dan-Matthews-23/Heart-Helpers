### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

What are the main accessibility issues with websites? What did you do to mitigate these? Did you include alt text for images? What about screen readers? Was the colour contrast right? What about the nav bar - what did you do with that to make it accessible?

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the review ratings for books & footer icons.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
