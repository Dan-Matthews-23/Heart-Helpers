### Colour

![HEART HELPERS COLOUR PALETTE](/assets/images/Final-Colour-Palette.png)

[Also available as Coolors palette](https://coolors.co/2b0201-911306-240101-5d0d04-cf4214)


I have chosen the above colour palette for the Heart Helpers website for several reasons. First, I wanted to use a palette that was easy for the users to see. I did research on what colours would be the most accessible to use. The Office for National Statistics suggest three helpful rules to consider when creating accessible websites:

- “Get it right in black and white”

- “The safest hue is blue”

- “Red and green should never be seen”

Following the advice of fellow students, I decided to use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for my palette. I've used this particular palette out of personal choice. I'm partially colourblind myself and have always appreciated a website with an appropiate contrast. 


### Font

The font I have chosen to use for Heart Helpers is one called Poppins, which is part of the Sans Sarif family. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=Heart%20Helpers&preview.text_type=custom). I chose the 'Light' weighting as I felt that it would look better against an off-white colour I planned to use as my background colour. 


### Images

Where did your images come from? Did ypu get permission? Did you credit them?



### Features



#### Header

My header will be comprised of the Heart Helpers logo (see above for images) that will also act as a hyperlink that will always bring the user back to the Home page. It will also contain the navigation bar which will change position depending on the user's device.


#### Footer

My footer will contain links to LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook and Twitter. 


#### Home Page

My Home page will begin with the Next Event with a large image (see Images) and a block of text describing what the event is, with a button just below called 'Sign Up'. If clicked, the button will take the user to the Get Involved page so that they can sign up to this event. 

The next thing the desktop and tablet users will see is an image of the previous event (in this case, the Winter Wonderland Event), showcasing a team of happy volunteers. This image will not be displayed on the mobile view.

Beneath the Winter Wonderland Event image, the user will be shown a series of four written testimonies from previous volunteers. All four will be shown to users regardless of the device they are using, however the way in which they see them will differ (see Wireframes).


#### Get Involved

Get Involved will be where the user can sign up to the next event by using a form that captures (through POST) the user's name, email address and date of birth. There is also a 'Confirm Email' address and a date selection for the date of birth, although neither of them have validation assigned to it (see Future Developments).

There is also a checkbox with a 'I agree with the Terms of Service' label assigned to it. There will be no data validation assigned to this checkbox. The label will carry a hyperlink that will take the user to the Terms of Service page. 


 ## Future Developments

There are several improvements I would like to make to Heart Helpers in the future when my knowledge and experience are improved.




|      Page     |   Future Development Ideas  | Reason not added in this release  |
| ------------  | ------------ | ------------ |
|  Get Involved | On:Hover option that explains why DOB is required  |  Limited knowledge of Javascript |
|  Get Involved | Javascript that will idenfity if the user is under 18. If yes, refer to sign-up-on-hold page, await parental consent  | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Get Involved | Data vadlidation on Confirm Email Address | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Get Involved | Data validation on Terms of Service checkbox | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Contact Us   | Data vadlidation on Contact Us form to detect value submission (more than 0, less than 'X') |  Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Contact Us   | Data validation on other input values (email address format, numerical only for telephone) | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  About Us     | Interactivity on central rounded image so that when user clicks, information sections are shown | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |


### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using alternative text for all images throughout the Heart Helpers website
- Using an accessible colour palette and contracts suitable for all users
- Using an easy to access navigation bar that clearly highlights which page the user is currently viewing
- Where possible, using screen reading tools where there is no alternative text available and the user is presented with an important feature (e.g. button, icon)
- Using semantic scripts

| ------------| ------------                    | -----------                                                                                                                            |
|  style.css  | #banner                         |  Developer Tools not updating CSS source code. Several tests failed. Deleted cache and tried again, passed on fifth attempt                        |
|  index.html | #happy-volunteers     |  Image not dissapearing on smaller screens. Consulted Bootstrap documentation and tested by replacing container class. Worked on 8th attempt                        |
|  style.css  | @media...max-width: 576px       |  Font size not changing across different viewports. On research, realised code incorrectly calling parent class not child. Worked on 4th attempt 
|  index.html | div.testimonies                 | The Testimonies div was not responsive to change in viewports. On smaller screen the breakpoint did not work. Studied Bootstrap module and realised my columns were wrong. Passed test on sixteenth test                         |
|  index.html | div.testimonies                 | Added second row of divs for the name of the user who submitted the testimonies. Did not pass the the responsiveness test when on small viewports, as the names collapsed into rows like the divs above. They need to stay beneath the testimony and not move. I've placed them in the same div and seperated with HR. They passed the test on the second attempt                         |
|  index.html | .title                 |    Title font failed responsiveness test and did not change with viewport. My mistake was trying to set '%'. After some research on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/) I found that the solution was to use viewport. Passed test on first attempt                     |
|  index.html | #logo                 |    Logo failed responsiveness test, did not resize with viewport. Advised by colleage to try using the img-fluid class. Test passed. See #Credits                      |
|  index.html | 'sign-up-promotion '                |    Sign-up-promotion section failed responsiveness test. On larger screens it veered to the left. I got an idea from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) to set a class decicated to alignment. Worked on second attempt                 |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    The responsinvess test failed. The background image did not change relative to the viewport as hoped. Instead I've created a new image that is a much smaller version that the original (shrunken in size)                 |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    The responsinvess test failed. rounded-circle div does not resize relative to the viewport as the logo rounded-circle. Up to twenty tests later I still could not figure it out. As a temporary fix I will force the browser to not display the section on smaller viewports. I will note this in the Known Bugs and come back to it when I have more time.                  |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    When trying to set a background image to the section with an alt of "speech mark" with the "img-fluid" class, the element failed the responsiveness test. I have ran dozens of tests with different versions of code and can't get it to work. This is something else I will try again when I have more time. In the meantime I have used a simple div with responsive text and no background image                  |
|  index.html | 'sign-up-promotion '             |    The div was being pushed up at the top over the top of the header. I realised this was because of the 'relative' positioning of my header, so I've created a seperate class called 'content' to specify that it should start below the header by setting the height pixels. It worked after ninth test                 |
|  index.html | Unclear, possible .sign-up promotion and nav bar              |    The page passed responsive testing on smaller screens but on larger screens the nav bar seemed to be crushed beneath the sign-up promotion div. It's not clear why. I think it has something to do with the position: relative for the heading. Tests ongoing                 |
|  style.css | .header{}, #nav-bar{}, content{}               |   After careful testing and configuration I realised that by setting the height in pixels of the three elements, it was causing the error above where the header section was crushed against the content and cauisng it to blend. I've removed the fixed heights of all three elements (bearing in mind that the .content height was only to correct a responsiveness error on the mobile view) and tested again, and it passed all resposiveness testing. I still don't fully understand why it happened. I will ask the community so I don't make the same mistake again                 |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness. Passed all tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness, in particular the new background image and rounded corners. On larger screens the tests failed responsiveness. Could not rectify               |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness, in particular the new background image and rounded corners. On larger screens the tests failed responsiveness. Spent a long time researching different ways of making the image responsive between the -img- / css-background-image properties, but could not make it responsive on larger screens. Tests failed               |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Set the CSS background-image properties to background-size-cover after some research on W3 schools. Header then passed first stage of responsive testing. Next stage will be new row with mirror-version of rounded DIV.                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   New DIV created in header that has a breakpoint on large and smaller screens. Passed all resposinveness testing                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   New content added to header section and tested for responsiveness. Passed all tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Added new button to header section to donate now. Failed interactivity tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   Tested element for responsiveness. Failed tests on smaller devices. The block of text was not wrapping and was instead being lost in the curve of the DIV. Need to find a way of wrapping it more                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   Changed the curve of the DIV from 100% to 95%. Passed all responsiveness tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   On larger screens the div containing the header text was crushing itself together. Respinsiveness test failed                 |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   The parent of the nested DIV that contained the header test was set to col-6 on larger screens. I have removed all bootstrap from that line. Test passed responsiveness tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | #nav-bar             |   Tested links on nav-bar to make sure they worked. Passed all tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice             |   The DIVs were being pushed beneath one another for no apparent reason. Attempts to correct failed               |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice             |   A class called 'align-center' was causing the error above. Removed class, passed tests               |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice-icons             |   AAfter some research and a section of code I wrote that was based on a snippet I found from Scaler.com (see Acknowledgements)  I tested the new icons for scalability and responsiveness. Passed all tests              |
|  contact-us.html / style.css | .sign-up             |   I incorrectly created the page for desktop rather than mobile-first. As a result the page failed all responsiveness tests and did not maintain cohension on smaller screens. I will make use of Bootstrap columns to correct this, but it's possible I may need to redesign the page considering how I've set it all out. Progress ongoing. UPDATE: Used media queries rather than bootstrap, passed all tests            |
|  All pages | All images            |   When deplying my site to GitHub none of the images would load. I had to commit many times to try to figure this out. Along the way I was asdvised by a peer that I could use Developer Tools to try and correct the error without having to keep commiting and pushing. I soon figured out that GitHub does not like a filepath like the one I was using (assets/images). This worked after some help from a peer and my own testing (see acknowledgements)            |
