# Heart Helpers
## User Experience (UX)

### Background

Heart Helpers are a fictional charitiable organisation that aim to generate revenue and attract volunteers to support in local and national events in the interest of raising money for people affected by heart disease. Heart Helpers have twelve branches across the United Kingdom. Each branch hosts fundraising activities in their local communities such as sponsored walks and events with their local authority to raise awareness, particularly in schools and community centres. Each branch participates in quarterly national events organised by the central team. This website aims to showcase such events and attract new participents. 


There are two main aims for the website:

- Recruit new and existing volunteers to help with nationally-organised events
- Provide a means for the user to contact the organisers or their local branch


#### Key information for the site

- Information on the next national event
- Information about previous events
- Testimonies of previous and existing volunteers
- A means for contacting  the national team or the twelve branches across the United Kingdom


### About the user
The website is designed with an end user in mind: a person who is looking to support Heart Helpers main aim of increasing revenue. Personal or protected charateristics are largely irrelevant, and as such Heart Helpers will not collect information other than name, email address, contact number (if the user wants to provide it) and date of birth. Date of birth is the only peice of information that is important for tax and health and safety reasons. 

**Tax reasons** - Under UK tax regulations, charities can claim back 25% of most donations from the UK government as Tax Aid. But for charities to be able to do that, the person making the donation or purchase must be liable for [tax ](https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid), which means only volunteers over the age of 16 would qualify for Gift Aid. It is important to note here that a person under 16 years of age would we welcomed just the same, provided they satisfy the Health and Safety agreement. 

**Health and Safety** - For Heart Helpers, a volunteer under the age of 16 needs parental consent to volunteer. This falls in line with relevant [guidance](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/safeguarding-child-protection/working-with-young-volunteers) and covers the organisers of the events against anything that could happen. 

**Disclaimer: It's important to note here that I am not a qualified tax person or a health and safety executive, and if I were designing this project for a client I would consult the relevant H&S/Law professionals or leave this to the client to research. The Tax Reasons and Health and Safety aspect of Heart Helpers is only my interpretation and is designed as part of the fictional Terms and Condtitions**

#### User Goals

- To recieve the same user experience on multiple devices
- To find out about previous and upcoming events easily
- To sign up to volunteer on the next national event
- To allow users to find information on their local branch
- To allow the user to contact someone if they need more information


#### First Time Visitor Goals

- To find information on the next national event, and to sign up to it with ease
- To be presented with clear, factual information
- To be able to connect with a local branch or a central team


#### Returning Visitor Goals

- To sign up to the next event
- To read volunteer testimonies
- To contact the national team or local branch


#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- To find out how sucessful the previous events have been
- To read volunteer testimonies, or submit one

### Colour

![HEART HELPERS COLOUR PALETTE](/assets/images/Final-Colour-Palette.webp)

[Also available as Coolors palette](https://coolors.co/2b0201-911306-240101-5d0d04-cf4214)


I have chosen the above colour palette for the Heart Helpers website because I wanted to use a palette that was easy for the users to see. I did research on what colours would be the most accessible to use. [The Office for National Statistics](https://style.ons.gov.uk/data-visualisation/using-colours/accessibility-and-colours/) suggest three helpful rules to consider when creating accessible websites:

- “Get it right in black and white”

- “The safest hue is blue”

- “Red and green should never be seen”

To that end, I have chosen a mixture of black and white font, and primarily a mixture of deep red with orange to break up sections of the pages. I've kept these colours a darker shade so that the white font would be easily seen. I did struggle with the colour set. I'm partially colour blind myself which means I don't see shades of secondary or tertiary colours well at all. I've had to get feedback consistently on how easy the colours blended. I've also had a lot of support through the paid subscription of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), which was reccomended to me by a peer at the Code Institute. The service allowed me to create a colour scheme based on the image I uploaded, which really did help. Overall,  I'm confident that I have chosen a colour scheme that is accessible that meets my design specification. 

### Font

The font I have chosen to use for Heart Helpers is one called Poppins, which is part of the Sans Sarif family. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=Heart%20Helpers&preview.text_type=custom). I chose the 'Light' weighting as I felt that it would look better against the background colour. 


### Images

All of the images used on the Heart Helpers website are from Pexels.com, and the icons are from Font Awesome and Flaticon. The authors are noted and are available to view in the #Credits section.

### Features

#### Header

My header will be comprised of the Heart Helpers logo (see above for images) that will also act as a hyperlink that will always bring the user back to the Home page. It will also contain the navigation bar which will change position depending on the user's device.


#### Footer

My footer will contain links to LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook and Twitter. 


#### Home Page

My Home page will begin with the Next Event with a large image (see Images) and a block of text describing what the event is, with a button just below called 'Sign Up'. If clicked, the button will take the user to the Get Involved page so that they can sign up to this event. 

The next thing the desktop and tablet users will see is an image of the previous event (in this case, the Winter Wonderland Event), showcasing a team of happy volunteers. This image will not be displayed on the mobile view.

Beneath the Winter Wonderland Event image, the user will be shown a series of four written testimonies from previous volunteers. All four will be shown to users regardless of the device they are using, however the way in which they see them will differ (see Wireframes).


#### Get Involved

Get Involved will be where the user can sign up to the next event by using a form that captures (through POST) the user's name, email address and date of birth. There is also a 'Confirm Email' address and a date selection for the date of birth, although neither of them have validation assigned to it (see Future Developments).

There is also a checkbox with a 'I agree with the Terms of Service' label assigned to it. There will be no data validation assigned to this checkbox. The label will carry a hyperlink that will take the user to the Terms of Service page. 

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using alternative text for all images throughout the Heart Helpers website
- Using an accessible colour palette and contracts suitable for all users
- Using an easy to access navigation bar that clearly highlights which page the user is currently viewing
- Where possible, using screen reading tools where there is no alternative text available and the user is presented with an important feature (e.g. button, icon)
- Using semantic scripts



## Reflection

### Design

Referring back to my original design ideas, the end result was slightly different to what I initially planned in the following ways:

- **Heart Helpers Logo** - I did not include a logo in my end result project as I originally planned for two reasons:
  1) I could not find an image that was appropiate to the colour scheme, related to the theme of the project and could be scaled for responsiveness.
  2) After doing some research on other websites, I deemed it was not essential for a logo to be present on the website, since it did not affect the end user. 



- **Contact Us** -  I originally planned to have the contact details for all twelve branches on the website, however I felt that it was too much information for the user to absorb. Instead, I intergrated a drop-down menu into the Contact Us page so that a message could be sent to the local branch the user selects (obviously with added Javascript and/or Python which I don't know at this point).




- **Responsivness.** - My ideas for responsiveness across the pages was limited to what I knew at that point. I planned for Bootstrap to do most of the work, however I chose to use only a small portion of bootstrap for several reasons: 
  1) I wanted to exhert as much creative control over my project as possible
  2) Bootstrap is either limited in what it can do, or I lacked the knowledge to use it properly. I'm not sure which one it was but it's something I will learn before the next project. 

  As a result, I used Media Queries to do the things that I wanted Bootstrap to do, which I feel was a good choice to make as it gave me a great deal of flexability. 

  - **About Us, Previous Events** - I originally planned to have an About Us and Previous Events page alongside my end result pages, however I was advised by my mentor that the requirements for a pass is three pages, and advised me to write these pages only if I had time. Unfortunatly, I did run out of time, but I would add these pages at a later date if I had the time. 

  - **Confirm Sign-Up, confirmation email** - I had planned to intergrate a 'method="POST"' function to the user form on the Get Involved page that would take the user to another page that confirmed the user's name and send them a confirmation email as well as check their age. I chose not to do that for thefollowing reasons:
  1) I ran out of time to learn how to code a user form to send an automated email to the address the user supplies. I am confident that this will not take long to learn, however to make sure it works well and is fit for purpose, this should be added to the list of future developments. Instead, I created a simple 'thankyou' page that the user should be directed to.
  2) The 'POST' element to the form would not work, and would not take the user to the confirmation page. I contacted Tutor SUpport who told me that the 'POST' function will not work unless I code it with Javascript or a server-side language. They advised me to remove the 'method="POST' part completley and have only action="thankyou.html", which I did. 

  **Elements not included**
  I have chosen not to include any videos or audio in my project, simply because Heart Helpers is a fictional organisation and there is no material available that would be appropiate to include. I perhaps could have contacted the British Heart Foundation to ask for permission to use a promotional video, but due to the time constraints on this project that wasn't possible. If I were going to create this project for a client, I would ask for all promotional material (which could include YouTube videos, audio clips, multimedia) before I finalised the project so I could include it. I do feel as though a video about the facts of heart disease could have helped the end user and it is something I would include if I were to add future developments.

### Solved Bugs

|      Page   |   Feature                       | What went wrong and how you resolved it                                                                                                |

|  style.css  | #banner                         |  Developer Tools not updating CSS source code. Several tests failed. Deleted cache and tried again, passed on fifth attempt                        |
|  index.html | #happy-volunteers     |  Image not dissapearing on smaller screens. Consulted Bootstrap documentation and tested by replacing container class. Worked on 8th attempt                        |
|  style.css  | @media...max-width: 576px       |  Font size not changing across different viewports. On research, realised code incorrectly calling parent class not child. Worked on 4th attempt 
|  index.html | div.testimonies                 | The Testimonies div was not responsive to change in viewports. On smaller screen the breakpoint did not work. Studied Bootstrap module and realised my columns were wrong. Passed test on sixteenth test                         |
|  index.html | div.testimonies                 | Added second row of divs for the name of the user who submitted the testimonies. Did not pass the the responsiveness test when on small viewports, as the names collapsed into rows like the divs above. They need to stay beneath the testimony and not move. I've placed them in the same div and seperated with HR. They passed the test on the second attempt                         |
|  index.html | .title                 |    Title font failed responsiveness test and did not change with viewport. My mistake was trying to set '%'. After some research on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/) I found that the solution was to use viewport. Passed test on first attempt                     |
|  index.html | #logo                 |    Logo failed responsiveness test, did not resize with viewport. Advised by colleage to try using the img-fluid class. Test passed. See #Credits                      |
|  index.html | 'sign-up-promotion '                |    Sign-up-promotion section failed responsiveness test. On larger screens it veered to the left. I got an idea from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) to set a class decicated to alignment. Worked on second attempt                 |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    The responsinvess test failed. The background image did not change relative to the viewport as hoped. Instead I've created a new image that is a much smaller version that the original (shrunken in size)                 |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    The responsinvess test failed. rounded-circle div does not resize relative to the viewport as the logo rounded-circle. Up to twenty tests later I still could not figure it out. As a temporary fix I will force the browser to not display the section on smaller viewports. I will note this in the Known Bugs and come back to it when I have more time.                  |
|  index.html | .responsive-background-section              |    When trying to set a background image to the section with an alt of "speech mark" with the "img-fluid" class, the element failed the responsiveness test. I have ran dozens of tests with different versions of code and can't get it to work. This is something else I will try again when I have more time. In the meantime I have used a simple div with responsive text and no background image                  |
|  index.html | 'sign-up-promotion '             |    The div was being pushed up at the top over the top of the header. I realised this was because of the 'relative' positioning of my header, so I've created a seperate class called 'content' to specify that it should start below the header by setting the height pixels. It worked after ninth test                 |
|  index.html | Unclear, possible .sign-up promotion and nav bar              |    The page passed responsive testing on smaller screens but on larger screens the nav bar seemed to be crushed beneath the sign-up promotion div. It's not clear why. I think it has something to do with the position: relative for the heading. Tests ongoing                 |
|  style.css | .header{}, #nav-bar{}, content{}               |   After careful testing and configuration I realised that by setting the height in pixels of the three elements, it was causing the error above where the header section was crushed against the content and cauisng it to blend. I've removed the fixed heights of all three elements (bearing in mind that the .content height was only to correct a responsiveness error on the mobile view) and tested again, and it passed all resposiveness testing. I still don't fully understand why it happened. I will ask the community so I don't make the same mistake again                 |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness. Passed all tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness, in particular the new background image and rounded corners. On larger screens the tests failed responsiveness. Could not rectify               |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Tested new layout of -header- for layout and responsiveness, in particular the new background image and rounded corners. On larger screens the tests failed responsiveness. Spent a long time researching different ways of making the image responsive between the -img- / css-background-image properties, but could not make it responsive on larger screens. Tests failed               |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Set the CSS background-image properties to background-size-cover after some research on W3 schools. Header then passed first stage of responsive testing. Next stage will be new row with mirror-version of rounded DIV.                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   New DIV created in header that has a breakpoint on large and smaller screens. Passed all resposinveness testing                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   New content added to header section and tested for responsiveness. Passed all tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | -header-              |   Added new button to header section to donate now. Failed interactivity tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   Tested element for responsiveness. Failed tests on smaller devices. The block of text was not wrapping and was instead being lost in the curve of the DIV. Need to find a way of wrapping it more                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   Changed the curve of the DIV from 100% to 95%. Passed all responsiveness tests                |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   On larger screens the div containing the header text was crushing itself together. Respinsiveness test failed                 |
|  index.html / style.css | .row-header-right              |   The parent of the nested DIV that contained the header test was set to col-6 on larger screens. I have removed all bootstrap from that line. Test passed responsiveness tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | #nav-bar             |   Tested links on nav-bar to make sure they worked. Passed all tests                 |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice             |   The DIVs were being pushed beneath one another for no apparent reason. Attempts to correct failed               |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice             |   A class called 'align-center' was causing the error above. Removed class, passed tests               |
|  index.html / style.css | .user-choice-icons             |   AAfter some research and a section of code I wrote that was based on a snippet I found from Scaler.com (see Acknowledgements)  I tested the new icons for scalability and responsiveness. Passed all tests              |
|  contact-us.html / style.css | .sign-up             |   I incorrectly created the page for desktop rather than mobile-first. As a result the page failed all responsiveness tests and did not maintain cohension on smaller screens. I will make use of Bootstrap columns to correct this, but it's possible I may need to redesign the page considering how I've set it all out. Progress ongoing. UPDATE: Used media queries rather than bootstrap, passed all tests            |
|  All pages | All images            |   When deplying my site to GitHub none of the images would load. I had to commit many times to try to figure this out. Along the way I was asdvised by a peer that I could use Developer Tools to try and correct the error without having to keep commiting and pushing. I soon figured out that GitHub does not like a filepath like the one I was using (assets/images). This worked after some help from a peer and my own testing (see acknowledgements)            |

I tested this extensivley but I kept getting a 405 error. I then contacted Tutor Support for help. They advised me to remove the 'method="POST"' part because this would not work unless I used Javascript or a server-based language, which we have not yet covered in the modules. I have set the form to refer to the thankyou.html page instead, but this is an improvement I would like to make at a later date      |



### Peer Feedback

I did ask for a peer review of my code but wasn't able to get a response, so I asked my fellow classmates to review my project. They provided me with the following feedback:

- The W3C Validator button you have in the footer doesn't work
- There's a lot of white space on the thankyou.html page at the bottom
- The submission of the Contact Us page gives a 405 error
- There are duplicate Social Media icons in the footer
- The text on footer section on homepage needs to be moved up
- The text for Mary on homepage is overflowing
- Ian's story on Testimonies, mobile view has a huge blank space above

This is what I did to resolve it:

- Removed the W3C button in the footer. This was supposed to confirm that my code was W3c validated, but the link seems to have expired

- It seems there were several reasons for the errors in thankyou.html. I had duplicate external icons, and I had set the height of the footer as a static measurement. I fixed these errors, however that left me with a large chunk of white space in the middle of the screen. Despite my earlier statement, I have decided to add a video into this section after checking YouTube's terms of service, which meant I did not need permission from the British Heart Foundation to embed this video. It's important to note here that I have not included this just to get rid of white space. My intention is to have this video as part of an overall facts page. As such, I've added the following statement in the thankyou.html page: Before you go, we wanted to let you know that we're planning to introduce a 'Know Your Facts' section very soon, and your opnion really matters to us, so please do head over to our Contact Us page and give us your thoughts! Please take some time to watch the video below about one of the most important aspects of heart disease - Heart Attacks

- The Contact Us form has been amended to fall in line with the removal of the POST part of the form, as advised by Tutor Support

- The duplicate social media icons have now been removed

- The issue with the footer has now been corrected

- I've changed the border-radius of the row on testimonies.html to a 5% decrease. I did try to set padding, but this didn't have the effect I wanted. 

- I couldn't repeat the step to resolve the text for the Mary section on the homepage because I wanted the curve of the border-radius to be symetrical on both columns for the desired effect. Instead, I've set the width of the right column to a 5% decrease which pulls the text off the edge of the div. 

- Corrected a problem with the link on testimonies.html where the image should have been showing









### Validation and formatting
**Jigsaw validator**

I used W3 School's Jigsaw Validator for my CSS. The validator picked up 53 errors. 25 of these were relating to Bootstrap. However the remaining 28 errors were from my style.css file, overwhelmingly relating to invalid references I'd made (e.g. .header-text-font	Property font-display doesn't exist : block). As the vast majority of my CSS was created through manipulating code and learning the end result, I expected more than a few errors during the first check. There were also 419 warnings flagged, but again these related to Boostrap and was not something I could fix. I addressed all CSS issues, ran the validator again and it passed all validation with the output: Congratulations! No Error Found. This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG !


I have also used Jigsaw to validate my HTML code. There were 23 errors identified which mainly covered my 'alt' tags, which I found were placed inappropiatly. I resolved all HTML issues and ran the validator again. It showed no further errors. 



**Formatting**
I've used [Formatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html) to format my HTML and CSS code. I feel it was necessary to use a tool like this after I'd validated it, simply because this is my first project and I am very inexperienced as a developer at this point.

 ## Future Developments

There are several improvements I would like to make to Heart Helpers in the future when my knowledge and experience are improved.




|      Page     |   Future Development Ideas  | Reason not added in this release  |
| ------------  | ------------ | ------------ |
|  Get Involved | On:Hover option that explains why DOB is required  |  Limited knowledge of Javascript |
|  Get Involved | Javascript that will idenfity if the user is under 18. If yes, refer to sign-up-on-hold page, await parental consent  | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Get Involved | Data vadlidation on Confirm Email Address | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Get Involved | Data validation on Terms of Service checkbox | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Contact Us   | Data vadlidation on Contact Us form to detect value submission (more than 0, less than 'X') |  Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  Contact Us   | Data validation on other input values (email address format, numerical only for telephone) | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
|  About Us     | Interactivity on central rounded image so that when user clicks, information sections are shown | Limited knowledge of Javascript  |
| Know the Facts | This is not a page I was able to create, but it was something I was going to create if I had more time. I would include many facts about Heart Disease and perhaps even an information video, possibly a link to YouTube (if such a video exists).| This was not added to the end project simply due to time constraints on the project, although there was a technical skills gap involved too, as I'm unsure how to add videos to code at this time. UPDATE: This has now been included following peer feedback |










## Credits


The vast majority of my time spent developing this project was spent by creating code from various sources, adapting, testing and evaluating. At the start of this project I had next to no coding experience. However, one of my skills is to find relevant information from various sources and adapt it to suit my own needs. Apart from one instance, I have not used any code written by others anywhere in this project, but feel it important to note from where I've taken inspiration. 


**British Heart Foundation**

First and foremost, I have taken a lot of inspiration from the [British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/). I have volunteered with the British Heart Foundation for almost a decade and am familiar with how they fundraise and fully support their cause. I would like to think of Heart Helpers as a tribute, rather than an immitation of the British Heart Foundation. 
I also feel it important to note that I took away a lot of ideas on how my project would look based on how the British Heart Foundation website is set up. Notably the rounded corners, the User Choice section and the idea of two background images overlapping, it's not something I've seen before. I taught myself how to do all of this through W3 Schools and implemented it on my own project. The last thing I need to mention is that I contacted Tutor Support at the Code Institute about a concern I had around certain similarities my project had to the British Heart Foundation website. I then made a decision to change some elements of my own project so as not to be as similar. 


**W3 Schools**

The vast majority of coding I have learned for this project has come from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com). A few examples of this are [rounded borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp), [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) and [background properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php). The information and resources are brilliant and have been a major factor in my completing this project.


**Scaler.com**

It was Scaler.com that taught me how to create a line break (lines 133 - 154 in /assets/styles.css) in CSS code. I have noted in the file where the code starts and ends. This section of code is the only part of code I have not written myself, although I have adapted it for my own purposes. The code is available [here](https://www.scaler.com/topics/css-line-break/).
